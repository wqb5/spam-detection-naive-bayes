# 📧 Spam Detection using Naïve Bayes (From Scratch)

This project implements a Multinomial Naïve Bayes spam classifier from scratch using Python and NLP techniques.

## 🚀 Features

- Tokenization using NLTK
- Word frequency dictionaries per class
- Prior probability calculation
- Laplace smoothing
- Log-probability scoring
- Precision, Recall & F1-score evaluation
- Comparison of 4 configurations:
  - Log + Smoothing
  - Log only
  - Smoothing only
  - Neither

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains:
- HAM emails
- SPAM emails

Split into:
- Training set
- Test set

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python
- NLTK
- Math
- From-scratch implementation (No sklearn used)

## 📊 Evaluation Metric

F1-score is used to evaluate model performance.

## ⏱ Training

Training time is measured using Python’s time module.
